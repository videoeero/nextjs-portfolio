# Portfolio website with ReactJS/NextJS

Personal website to work as a portfolio / resume site. Done with ReactJS and NextJS. SASS used to make styling easier.

Currently running here: [http://findeero.now.sh/](http://findeero.now.sh/)

Feel free to use my source code for your own purposes, but please if you use the icons, remember to credit authors / buy licenses correctly. I got most of my icons here: [https://thenounproject.com/](https://thenounproject.com/)
